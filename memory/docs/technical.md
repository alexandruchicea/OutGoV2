# Technical Specifications Document

## 1. Introduction
*   **Project Name:** OutGo
*   **Document Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** June 30, 2025
*   **Author(s):** Engineering Team
*   **Purpose:** This document provides the technical specifications for the OutGo application.

## 2. Goals
*   **Technical Goals:** To build a scalable, performant, and maintainable web application using a modern tech stack.
*   **Business Goals:** To deliver a feature-rich and reliable platform for users, merchants, and administrators.

## 3. Development Environment
*   **Operating Systems:** Any OS that can run Node.js (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows).
*   **Programming Languages:** TypeScript.
*   **Frameworks:** Next.js.
*   **Libraries:** React, Supabase.js, Tailwind CSS (or another modern CSS framework).
*   **Development Tools:** VS Code, Node.js, npm/yarn, Git.

## 4. Technologies Used
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript.
    *   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, TypeScript.
    *   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL).
    *   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth.
    *   **Storage:** Supabase Storage.
    *   **Geolocation:** Browser Geolocation API.
*   **Technology Selection Rationale:**
    *   **Next.js:** Provides a robust framework for building both the frontend and backend, enabling server-side rendering for performance and SEO.
    *   **Supabase:** Offers a complete backend solution that simplifies development by providing a database, authentication, and file storage out-of-the-box.
    *   **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and improves code quality and maintainability.

## 5. API Specifications
*   The backend API will be implemented using Next.js API Routes.
*   The API will follow RESTful principles.
*   Requests and responses will be in JSON format.
*   Authentication will be handled via JWTs provided by Supabase Auth, sent in the Authorization header.

## 6. Data Storage
*   Data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase.
*   The database schema will be designed to be relational and will include tables for users, activities, bookings, merchants, etc.
*   Data access will be handled through the Supabase JavaScript client library in the Next.js backend.

## 7. Security Considerations
*   All user passwords will be hashed and salted by Supabase Auth.
*   Row-Level Security (RLS) will be enabled in the Supabase database to ensure users can only access their own data.
*   Input validation will be performed on all API routes to prevent injection attacks.
*   Environment variables will be used to store sensitive information like API keys.

## 8. Performance Considerations
*   Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) from Next.js will be used to optimize page load times.
*   Images will be optimized and served in modern formats.
*   Database queries will be optimized to minimize response times.

## 9. Scalability Considerations
*   The serverless nature of Next.js API Routes and Vercel allows for automatic scaling.
*   Supabase is designed to be scalable and can handle a large number of concurrent users.
