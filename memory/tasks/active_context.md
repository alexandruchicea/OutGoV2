# Current State of Development

## Current Work Focus:
*   Completed all P0 tasks: US-01, US-02, US-03, US-04, US-05, US-06, US-07, US-08, US-09, US-10.
*   Completed all P1 tasks: US-11, US-12, US-13, US-14.
*   Completed all P2 tasks: US-15, US-16, US-17, US-18.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
*   Prioritization of user stories based on P0, P1, P2 categories.
*   Identification of initial dependencies between tasks.
*   Detailed breakdown of each user story into actionable sub-tasks.

## Recent Changes:
*   Created `tasks_plan.md` based on `PRD - aplicatie tip Glovo.md`.
*   Updated `tasks_plan.md` with detailed sub-tasks for each user story.
*   Created `product_requirement_docs.md`, `architecture.md`, and `technical.md` based on the PRD and project context.
*   Implemented basic homepage layout and integrated navigation components.
*   Populated homepage with placeholder featured content.
*   Confirmed existing sign-in/registration CTAs, buttons/links, and routing.
*   Designed sign-up form UI/UX with placeholder validation messages.
*   Designed login form UI/UX with placeholder error messages.
*   Implemented client-side validation for the sign-up form.
*   Implemented client-side validation for the login form.
*   Developed backend API for user registration.
*   Developed backend API for user authentication (login).
*   Confirmed secure password hashing and storage handled by Supabase.
*   Integrated frontend forms with backend APIs.
*   Completed all P0, P1, and P2 user stories as per `tasks_plan.md`.
*   Resolved database schema issues for `activities` and `merchants` tables.
*   Fixed client component errors in `signin/page.tsx` and `signup/page.tsx`.
*   Resolved user sign-up data not saving by implementing profile creation logic in the sign-up API and updating the sign-up form.
*       Abstracted admin check logic into `src/outgo-app/src/utils/auth/roles.ts` and updated all relevant files to use this new utility.
*   Secured admin email by replacing hardcoded values with an environment variable (`ADMIN_EMAIL`) and updating `.env.local`.
*   Converted the main activities page to a server component, moving data fetching to the server and creating a new client component for interactive filters.
*   Refactored activity filtering and search functionality into a new client component `src/outgo-app/src/components/ActivityFilters.tsx`, and integrated it into `src/outgo-app/src/app/activities/page.tsx`.
*   Refactored Create and Edit Activity modals in `src/outgo-app/src/app/admin/activities/page.tsx` into separate components (`CreateActivityModal.tsx` and `EditActivityModal.tsx`).
*   Refactored social interaction logic (comments, likes, ratings, favorites) in `src/outgo-app/src/app/activities/[id]/page.tsx` into custom hooks (`useComments.ts`, `useLikes.ts`, `useFavorites.ts`, `useRatings.ts`).
*   Fixed authentication state not updating immediately after sign-in/sign-out by resolving synchronous `cookies()` calls in `src/outgo-app/src/utils/supabase/server.ts`, `src/outgo-app/src/app/layout.tsx`, and `src/outgo-app/src/app/api/auth/signin/route.ts`, and adding `router.refresh()` to `src/outgo-app/src/app/signin/page.tsx`.

*   Fixed authentication state not updating immediately after sign-in/sign-out by resolving synchronous `cookies()` calls in `src/outgo-app/src/utils/supabase/server.ts`, `src/outgo-app/src/app/layout.tsx`, and `src/outgo-app/src/app/api/auth/signin/route.ts`, and adding `router.refresh()` to `src/outgo-app/src/app/signin/page.tsx`.
*   Configured `next.config.ts` to allow image loading from `example.com` to resolve `next/image` unconfigured hostname error.

## Next Steps:
*   Thoroughly test all implemented features to ensure they meet the requirements and are free of bugs. (Initial testing of homepage, sign-in, and sign-up routes completed, including user profile creation.)
*   Review the UI/UX for any improvements, and optimize code for performance and maintainability.
*   Prepare the application for deployment to the production environment.
