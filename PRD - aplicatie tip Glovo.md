### **1\. Overview: The "Why"**

#### **1.1. Problem Statement**

New and returning users need a seamless way to discover, book, and manage activity-based experiences while merchants and administrators require functional tools to operate and monitor business interactions efficiently. Current platforms fail to provide a unified, engaging, and customizable ecosystem that meets the diverse needs of these roles.

#### **1.2. Proposed Solution**

We will build a mobile-first application that offers users activity discovery, scheduling, and social engagement tools, while also supporting merchants with registration and dashboard analytics. The admin experience will focus on moderation and operational control.

#### **1.3. Strategic Alignment / Business Case**

This project aligns with our core objective of building an end-to-end marketplace for experiences. It opens new monetization streams through bookings, in-app payments, and targeted recommendations. By providing tools for both sides of the marketplace (consumers and merchants), we increase user stickiness and platform value.
